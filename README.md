# Complex Multicontainer App

I built this app while going through Stephen Grider's [Docker and Kubernetes: The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/) course.

The purpose of building this app was to become more comfortable with Docker, GitHub Actions, and a number of different AWS services.

Note: While this project can be properly built, and would've been deployable in the past, it cannot be deployed error-free in 2022 to AWS because of some recent changes to the new EBS environment.
